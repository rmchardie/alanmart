    "postContent": "All regulated care services have a duty of candour. \r\n\r\nThis is a legal requirement which means that when things go wrong and mistakes happen the people affected understand what has happened, receive an apology and that the organisation learn how to improve for the future.\r\n\r\n Part of the legislation requires Alanmart to publish an annual report about duty of candour in our services. This short report describes how Alanmart has operated the duty of candour between 1st April 2019 and 31st March 2020. Alanmart day care is a social care facility in Stenhousemuir. \r\n\r\nUp until 22nd March we were operating a service for 15 clients each day providing social care for people who need some assistance with an aspect of life that through illness or infirmity can no longer provide for themselves. We aim to ensure that each client has a positive experience every time they attend Alanmart and that care we give is personal, tailored to the needs of the individual. \r\n\r\nThe incidents to be included in an annual report of Duty of Candour are those which are unintended or unexpected and do not relate directly to the natural course of someone\u2019s illness or underlying condition. \r\n\r\nWe are happy to report that over the course of the year we have had no occasions to trigger using the Duty of Candour Requirement The care inspectorate\u2019s website has more information on the Duty of Candour where you can also find information regarding Alanmart\u2019s Inspection Reports carried out by the Inspectorate.",
