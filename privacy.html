          We use the reCAPTCHA service provided by Google Inc. (Google) to

        <p>
          Only in exceptional cases is a full IP address trasmitted to a Google
          server in the United States and truncated there. On behalf of the
          operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate
          your use of this service. The IP address provided by reCAPTCHA from
          your browser shall not be merged with any other data from Google.
