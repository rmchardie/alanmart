            Every day at Alanmart should be the best it can be and that is why
            we build our community on support and care based on the belief that
            life should be enjoyed at every stage. Our model sees every
            individual as having the ability to flourish regardless of age or
            circumstance.
          </p>
          <p>It depends on the promotion of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Honest emotion</li>
            <li>Engagement in our community</li>

          <p>
            At Alanmart we recognise the importance of food, both nutritionally
            and socially. Our cook prepares a homemade 3 course meal with a
            choice of a starter and a main course. Special diets are catered for
            and clients can also choose portion size.
          </p>
          <p>Drinks are offered and available throughout the day.</p>

          <p>
            Decorating is something we enjoy here at Alanmart - in fact we
            decorate for every occasion!
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather ambitiously we make a lot of our own decorations to suit the
            festivity, our recent purchase being a potter's wheel and clay...
            this, however, is harder than it looks!
          </p>
          <p>
            We also offer card making, painting, drawing, knitting and crochet.

          <h2 class="title">Quizzes, crosswords & games</h2>
          <p>
            These activities are very popular and we do these both individually
            and in a group. Our most popular game is dominoes enjoyed by old
            hands and novices alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            Word games are also a favourite choice including scrabble, word
            search and hang man. Besides these traditional games, everyone has
            access to the Internet via our iPads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our clients can also choose to have quiet time as we supply
            newspapers and magazines to use in our quiet room.

          <h2 class="title">Wishing Tree</h2>
          <p>
            Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, we introduced our Wishing Tree at
            Alanmart.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the wishing tree is to grant a wish for each of our
            clients, these wishes don't need to be big gestures, simply a desire
            they would like fulfilled.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tree is an ongoing activity, which so far has proven to be a
            success. Some ideas we have had, have been trips to Bo'ness Railway,
            South Queensferry for lunch and some shopping trips.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also went with a client to Greenock where we visited the site
            where his ship left for the D-day landings and visited the Cross of
            Lorraine Memorial.
          </p>
          <p>
            We look forward to making and completing new wishes in the future.

          <h2 class="title">Keeping Active</h2>
          <p>
            We offer and encourage everyone to participate in physical activity.
            Our most popular activity is chair yoga which is carried out to
            music.
          </p>
          <p>
            People can also play basketball, skittles and quotes from their
            armchair.

          <h2 class="title">Trips out</h2>
          <p>
            Since the pandemic, our trips have been severely curtained. As
            restrictions ease and things get back to normal, we hope to resume
            these.
